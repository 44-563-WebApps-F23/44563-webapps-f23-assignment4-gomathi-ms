    laboriously as he comes forward into the doorway.</p> No, I can't bear it
    much longer!</p>

<h4>KAIA.</h4>

<p><p>Going up to him.</p> You are feeling very ill this evening, are you not,
Uncle?</p>


<h4>BROVIK.</h4>

<h4>RAGNAR.</h4>

<p><p>Has risen and advances.</p>You ought to go home, father. Try to get a
little sleep--</p>


<h4>BROVIK.</h4>

<p><p>Impatiently.</p> Go to bed, I suppose? Would you have me stifled outright?</p>


<h4>KAIA.</h4>

Then take a little walk.


<h4>RAGNAR.</h4>

<p>Yes, do. I will come with you.</p>


<h4>BROVIK.</h4>

<p><p>With warmth.</p> I will not go till he comes! I and determined to have
it out this evening with--[in a tone of suppressed bitterness]--with

<h4>KAIA.</h4>

<p><p>Anxiously.</p> Oh no, uncle,--do wait awhile before doing that!</p>
