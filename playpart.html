        <p class="speech"><p class="direction">Rises suddenly, as if in distress, from the table; breathes heavily and
            laboriously as he comes forward into the doorway.</p> No, I can't bear it

        <h4 class="name">BROVIK.</h4>

        <p class="speech"><p class="direction">With warmth.</p> I will not go till he comes! I and determined to have
        it out this evening with--<p class="direction">in a tone of suppressed bitterness</p>--with
        him--with the chief.</p>

        <h4 class="name">KAIA.</h4>

        <p class="speech"><p class="direction">Anxiously.</p> Oh no, uncle,--do wait awhile before doing that!</p>
